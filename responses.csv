Maybe that's paste tense, but I probably have affordances to avoid triggering it too.

I use base16-shell to configure a colorscheme using ANSI escapes, and not all terminals support it. (Cool retro term, most notably, but that's mostly just a joke.)

It doesn't happen often, but having multiple programs competing for stdin is pretty gross. It's usually the ruby REPL competing with bash. `eexxitt<enter><enter>`.

Line-spacing not working and unicode line/box drawing characters having incorrect gaps between lines is annoying. I think some terminals (xterm?) draw these manually to avoid this, but new ones get added periodically and they probably only handle the original lot.

Every OS that can't use fontconfig (i.e. Windows & MacOS) to patch in nerd font symbols dynamically to every font makes me sad, and I guess that's really a terminal concern.",
